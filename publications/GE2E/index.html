    <h3>Abstract</h3>

    <p>
      In this paper, we propose a new loss function called generalized
      end-to-end (GE2E) loss, which makes the training of speaker verification
      models more efficient than our previous tuple-based end-to-end (TE2E)
      loss function. Unlike TE2E, the GE2E loss function updates the network
      in a way that emphasizes examples that are difficult to verify at each
      step of the training process. Additionally, the GE2E loss does not
      require an initial stage of example selection. With these properties,
      our model with the new loss function decreases speaker verification EER
      by more than 10%, while reducing the training time by 60% at the same
      time. We also introduce the MultiReader technique, which allows us to
      do domain adaptation - training a more accurate model that supports
      multiple keywords (i.e. "OK Google" and "Hey Google") as well as
      multiple dialects.

    <h3>Implementations</h3>

    <p>
      The implementations of the GE2E loss has heavy dependencies on Google's
      internal libraries, thus <b>CANNOT</b> be open sourced.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are aware of several third-party implementations of this work, such as:
      <li><a href="https://github.com/Janghyun1230/Speaker_Verification">
          TensorFlow implementation by Janghyun1230</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/HarryVolek/PyTorch_Speaker_Verification">
          PyTorch implementaion by HarryVolek</a></li>
    </p>

    <p>
      However, please note that
      <b>we are NOT responsible for the correctness of any third-party
        implementations.</b>
      Please use your own judgement to decide whether you want to use these
      implementations.
