Well that suc- Are you you guys are staying in the house right? ca- yeah. yeah That's what Lee said. I forgot yeah. But who's going to live with you? I don't know. I was hoping it was going to be you. oh But oh well Lee said that that you guys wanted to try to live by yourself. No that's what he wanted oh okay because he told me because he told me you know that you guys that was because Suzy was moving out and then he said if I w- if I needed a place to stay I could stay there but you guys had wanted to like try and live just you two. oh. Well that wa- that was his plan. And I said to him no, I want to live with Stephanie. oh really. I didn't know that. I wouldn't have gotten like my apartment and oh really yeah oh I'm sorry. We'll blame him. Maybe you could get your money back now I don't know. I mean if it's a month to month lease, so I'm sure oh really. yeah. How much? But I d- It's two ninety-five a month. mhm. Which is pretty good. yeah that's good for a one bedroom. yeah I might I don't know, I think that I want to live by myself yeah. Well you've wanted that for a while. yeah. so Now that I have, but I didn't, I wouldn't have done that if I would have known it was like definite that you wanted me to live with you. Well th- but I said to him, I don't know if Stephanie could live with me because I'm such a slob. oh I can't live with with Henry and Leroy because they're slobs and they're and they don't listen to me. yeah see I thought you w- you might have like gotten used to living with slobs oh since they were. Well no it's just that they like I mean I'm sure you would respect my like cleanliness. But they don't. yeah. No I I try and keep it all in my room. But mm what is Ann going to do? um I don't know. But I know that she won't live with me because I hate John. oh, I forgot about him. yeah. That's that was like the last thing she said to me before I left oh. was that we could never live together because of him. Which is fine by me. yeah. Because you know when he comes he comes for like three weeks. yeah. And I would just go insane. yeah. hm so I I really hate him I had to- I had totally forgot about him. I guess I k- sort of like blocked him out. I I think most people do. But yeah So That's kind of that. But it's weird. I haven't heard from her all summer. really? yeah I wrote her but she didn't write back. mm. But her birthday is Thursday so I should probably call. I think. I don't know. Have you talked to Nettie? No. mm. No I haven't. w- we played pool with them like on Saturday night. uh-huh. with her and Anders and some guy named Mica. oh that's oh I know him. He's my my friend Medea's brother. oh that's Medea's brother? yeah. oh wow. yeah. They don't look like each other. I've a- I've actu- h- I don't know if I've ever, I've only seen him from afar. oh. He looks like John Travolta but he has like curly blond hair. oh really yeah. He's supposed to be pretty cool. yeah he is. He was real nice, yeah. He is? oh that's good. Well that's nice. Anders doesn't live with him, does he? No um, he's like Nick's friend or something. oh. Or Mick or what's that guy's May's boyfriend? m- I don't kno- Nick. yeah Nick. yeah And I guess like Nick and May were going to go but they didn't. But they asked this guy Mica mhm. to come I don't know. Now do Nettie and Anders live together? No um Anders is living at like on Wesley. I don't know if he lived there before. Still with that guy Mark. Right. yeah. And um And Nettie like started living in this place on Girard. uh-huh. You know h- like going to your house. oh okay. And um you know across the street from Jefferson Jefferson Middle School. yeah. That's going to your house, right? yeah. She lives right across the street from there. oh well that's nice. and she lives with somebody named Christine and yeah. Lily or something. yeah they were in one of my classes with her. mhm. I remember. Like Christine she's kind of big. yeah. yeah. And then Lily is like has blond hair. I don't know if you know her. I don't think I know her, but I've heard of her. yeah then it's like hm When did she move in there? Like in June I think. uh-huh. Is it nice? It's okay, it's kind of gross. Like oh There's like roaches all over the place and stuff oh god. Nettie would hate that I think. yeah she was going like quite crazy. And like I guess the girl who had it before like didn't know how to clean like period. And it was all gross and stuff. uh-huh. But they we went on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so mhm. I guess it's okay. oh. Well that's good. mm. yeah. The only person I talk to is Mark Diener. Ho- how many times have you talked to him? He calls every Thursday. Really. yeah. But he's just so cute, I can't say no. He's gotten much better too. oh really. yeah he doesn't get on my nerves. But he gets on my mom's nerves. oh really. Because when she answers the phone he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour. And then she's always like I have to go I have to go. Typical Mark. definitely So I I told him that my mom's like afraid of the telephone and she doesn't like to talk. But he's the only one. m- yeah. hm. I- does anyone hang out with Suzy? mm, no. No. That's good. I guess um I guess little Felipe is staying at your house. yeah, I heard that might happen. yeah. And um I bet she loves that. oh yeah. And every time I ask, because I see him at Kinko's all the time uh-huh. And um He's like she never leaves the house. All she does is bitch. But it's so true. He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then stays home like the rest of the day yeah. Why am I not surprised? yeah. So when I was thinking of who I was going to call, because you know this phone call is free. oh it is? yeah and I was So we can talk as long as we want. and like Well actually it's supposed to turn off in fifteen minutes. I think the whole thing is screwy. oh. But you know my dad was like well why don't you call Suzy. And I'm like that is the last person that I want to talk to. For fifteen minutes. I mean I talked to her like three weeks ago and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill. Which I did. And she just forgot. Because she spent the money on something else. And I was just like, whatever. She's totally nutsy. If she like ends up trying to stay I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. Well I think she's already determined to leave, isn't she? yeah, but see, it's just like her the last minute be too lazy Right. to go through with it. yeah, I mean that's just, generally speaking, her personality. yeah. Because she was telling us she was going to move out last January. mm. And she was too lazy to do it. So maybe Felipe will drive her out. oh god I can't stand her.",

And it was all gross and stuff. <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> But they we went on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so <speaker:1> mhm. <speaker:2> I guess it's okay. <speaker:1> oh. Well that's good. mm. yeah. The only person I talk to is Mark Diener. <speaker:2> Ho- how many times have you talked to him? <speaker:1> He calls every Thursday. <speaker:2> Really. <speaker:1> yeah. But he's just so cute, I can't say no. He's gotten much better too. <speaker:2> oh really. <speaker:1> yeah he doesn't get on my nerves. But he gets on my mom's nerves. <speaker:2> oh really. <speaker:1> Because when she answers the phone he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour. And then she's always like I have to go I have to go. Typical Mark. <speaker:2> definitely <speaker:1> So I I told him that my mom's like afraid of the telephone and she doesn't like to talk. But he's the only one. m- <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> hm. I- does anyone hang out with Suzy? <speaker:2> mm, no. <speaker:1> No. That's good. <speaker:2> I guess um I guess little Felipe is staying at your house. <speaker:1> yeah, I heard that might happen. <speaker:2> yeah. And um <speaker:1> I bet she loves that. <speaker:2> oh yeah. And every time I ask, because I see him at Kinko's all the time <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> And um He's like she never leaves the house. All she does is bitch. <speaker:1> But it's so true. <speaker:2> He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then stays home like the rest of the day <speaker:1> yeah. Why am I not surprised? yeah. So when I was thinking of who I was going to call, because you know this phone call is free. <speaker:2> oh it is? <speaker:1> yeah and I was <speaker:2> So we can talk as long as we want. <speaker:1> and like Well actually it's supposed to turn off in fifteen minutes. I think the whole thing is screwy. <speaker:2> oh. <speaker:1> But you know my dad was like well why don't you call Suzy. And I'm like that is the last person that I want to talk to. <speaker:2> For fifteen minutes. <speaker:1> I mean I talked to her like three weeks ago and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill. Which I did. And she just forgot. Because she spent the money on something else. And I was just like, whatever. She's totally nutsy. If she like ends up trying to stay I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. <speaker:2> Well I think she's already determined to leave, isn't she? <speaker:1> yeah, but see, it's just like her the last minute be too lazy <speaker:2> Right. <speaker:1> to go through with it. yeah, I mean that's just, generally speaking, her personality. <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> Because she was telling us she was going to move out last January. <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> And she was too lazy to do it. So maybe Felipe will drive her out. oh god I can't stand her.",

listen to me <speaker:1> And see I thought you you might have like gotten used to living with lobs <speaker:2> No <speaker:1> they were <speaker:2> Well no it's just that they like I mean I'm sure you

      "ref_diarized_text_degraded": "<speaker:1> Right. <speaker:2> And I I already got another apartment for when I move out. oh <speaker:1> you did. <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> Where? <speaker:2> it's on the corner of Columbia and Cole. <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> And it's a one bedroom and so I had to put down like a deposit and um you know and pay the rent for it so I could hold it. <speaker:1> mhm. But <speaker:2> that's okay. oh good. Then I won't have to, you know how all the people are looking for houses now. yeah. <speaker:1> yeah, I'm sure they are. Well that's good. Well so what have you been doing other than work? <speaker:2> um Not really much of anything. um I usually I just come home from work and like stay home and e- I don't know. I haven't done much. <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> We went to Santa <speaker:1> Fe <speaker:2> yesterday <speaker:1> oh yeah. <speaker:2> you know me and Henry. <speaker:1> Well that's cool. <speaker:2> yeah but otherwise it's been a kind of boring summer. <speaker:1> mhm. Like <speaker:2> nobody's here. Just like Henry and Leroy yeah. <speaker:1> yeah it's been boring for me too. But at least I'm saving money I guess. <speaker:2> yeah when are you coming back? <speaker:1> The nineteenth. <speaker:2> oh When does school start? The <speaker:1> twenty-second. <speaker:2> oh okay. I don't even know. I just knew it was around the twentieth. <speaker:1> yeah. I think it's the twenty-second. <speaker:2> mhm. <speaker:1> But yeah <speaker:2> Have you talked to Lee? <speaker:1> um yes. I haven't talked to him since I think like Tuesday. <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> But he's coming back to Albequerque tomorrow. oh <speaker:2> he is. <speaker:1> yeah. <speaker:2> I thought he was going to Philadelphia. <speaker:1> No. No h- he doesn't have the money. <speaker:2> oh okay. <speaker:1> And then I couldn't get off work <speaker:2> oh. So <speaker:1> if he came then like I would still have to go to work. oh <speaker:2> okay. <speaker:1> So we decided that that was a waste. <speaker:2> Because when you went to Oregon he told me that he was he wasn't going to be back until like August because he was going to like visit you. <speaker:1> yeah. yeah that was originally the plan but then like apparently my mom agreed <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> that I would work for this place for exactly three months. Like and I didn't know that <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> So I'm required to work until the sixteenth. <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> So It's kind of a bummer. <speaker:2> Well that suc- Are you you guys are staying in the house right? ca- yeah. yeah That's what Lee said. I forgot <speaker:1> yeah. But <speaker:2> who's going to live with you? <speaker:1> I don't know. I was hoping it was going to be you. <speaker:2> oh But oh well Lee said that that you guys wanted to try to live by yourself. <speaker:1> No that's what he wanted oh <speaker:2> okay because he told me because he told me you know that you guys that was because Suzy was moving out and then he said if I w- if I needed a place to stay I could stay there but you guys had wanted to like try and live just you two. <speaker:1> oh. Well that wa- that was his plan. And I said to him no, I want to live with Stephanie. <speaker:2> oh really. I didn't know that. I wouldn't have gotten like my apartment and <speaker:1> oh really yeah oh I'm sorry. We'll blame him. Maybe you could get your money back now <speaker:2> I don't know. I mean if it's a month to month lease, so I'm sure <speaker:1> oh really. <speaker:2> yeah. How much? But I d- It's two ninety-five a month. <speaker:1> mhm. <speaker:2> Which is pretty good. <speaker:1> yeah that's good for a one bedroom. <speaker:2> yeah I might I don't know, I think that I want to live by myself <speaker:1> yeah. Well you've wanted that for a while. <speaker:2> yeah. so Now that I have, but I didn't, I wouldn't have done that if I would have known it was like definite that you <speaker:1> wanted me to live <speaker:2> with you. <speaker:1> Well th- but I said to him, I don't know if Stephanie could live with me because I'm such a slob. <speaker:2> oh I can't live with with Henry and Leroy because they're slobs and they're and they don't listen to me. yeah <speaker:1> see I thought you w- you might have like gotten used to living with slobs <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> since they were. <speaker:2> Well no it's just that they like I mean I'm sure you would respect my like cleanliness. But they don't. yeah. <speaker:1> No I I try and keep it all in my room. But <speaker:2> mm <speaker:1> what is <speaker:2> Ann going to do? <speaker:1> um I don't know. But I know that she won't live with me because I hate John. <speaker:2> oh, I forgot about him. yeah. <speaker:1> That's that was like the last thing she said to me before I left oh. was that we could never live together because of him. Which is fine by me. yeah. Because you know when he comes he comes for like three weeks. yeah. <speaker:2> And <speaker:1> I would just go insane. yeah. hm so I I really hate him <speaker:2> I had to- I had totally forgot about him. I guess I k- sort of like blocked him out. I <speaker:1> I <speaker:2> think <speaker:1> most people do. But yeah So That's kind of that. But it's weird. I haven't heard from her all summer. <speaker:2> really? <speaker:1> yeah I wrote her but she didn't write back. <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> But her birthday is Thursday so I should probably call. I think. I <speaker:2> don't know. Have you talked to Nettie? <speaker:1> No. <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> No <speaker:2> I haven't. w- we played pool with them like on Saturday night. <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> with her and Anders and some guy named Mica. <speaker:1> oh that's oh I know him. He's my my friend Medea's brother. oh that's Medea's brother? yeah. <speaker:2> oh wow. yeah. They don't look like each other. <speaker:1> I've a- I've actu- h- I don't know if I've ever, I've only seen him from afar. <speaker:2> oh. He looks like John Travolta but he has like curly blond hair. <speaker:1> oh really yeah. He's supposed to be pretty cool. <speaker:2> yeah he is. He was real nice, yeah. <speaker:1> He is? oh that's good. Well that's nice. Anders doesn't live with him, does he? <speaker:2> No um, he's like Nick's friend or something. oh. Or Mick or what's that guy's May's boyfriend? <speaker:1> m- <speaker:2> I don't kno- <speaker:1> Nick. yeah Nick. <speaker:2> yeah And I guess like Nick and May were going to go but they didn't. But they asked this guy Mica <speaker:1> mhm. <speaker:2> to come I don't know. <speaker:1> Now do Nettie and Anders live together? <speaker:2> No um Anders is living at like on Wesley. I don't know if he lived there before. <speaker:1> Still with <speaker:2> that <speaker:1> guy Mark. <speaker:2> Right. <speaker:1> yeah. <speaker:2> And um And Nettie like started living in this place on Girard. <speaker:1> uh-huh. <speaker:2> You know h- like going to your house. <speaker:1> oh okay. <speaker:2> And um you know across the street from Jefferson Jefferson Middle School. <speaker:1> yeah. <speaker:2> That's going to your house, right? <speaker:1> yeah. She <speaker:2> lives right across the street from there. <speaker:1> oh well that's nice. <speaker:2> and she lives with somebody named Christine and <speaker:1> yeah. <speaker:2> Lily or something. <speaker:1> yeah they were in one of my classes with her. <speaker:2> mhm. <speaker:1> I remember. Like Christine she's kind of big. <speaker:2> yeah. yeah. And then Lily is like has blond hair. I don't know if you know her. <speaker:1> I don't think I know her, but I've heard of her. <speaker:2> yeah then it's like <speaker:1> hm <speaker:2> When did she move in there? Like in June I think. <speaker:1> uh-huh. Is it nice? <speaker:2> It's okay, it's kind of gross. Like oh There's like roaches all over the place and stuff oh <speaker:1> god. Nettie would hate that I think. yeah <speaker:2> she was going like quite crazy. And like I guess the girl who had it before like didn't know how to clean like period. And it was all gross and stuff. <speaker:1> uh-huh. But <speaker:2> they we went on Saturday and they had fit they put new carpet and stuff so <speaker:1> mhm. I <speaker:2> guess it's okay. <speaker:1> oh. Well that's good. mm. yeah. The only person I talk to is Mark Diener. <speaker:2> Ho- how many times have you talked to him? <speaker:1> He calls every Thursday. Really. <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> But <speaker:2> he's just so cute, I can't say no. He's gotten much better too. oh really. <speaker:1> yeah he doesn't get on my nerves. But he gets on my mom's nerves. oh really. Because when she answers the phone he like wants to talk to her for like a half an hour. And then she's always like I have to go I have to go. Typical Mark. definitely So I I told him that my mom's like afraid of the telephone and she doesn't like to talk. But he's the only one. m- <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> hm. I- does anyone hang out with Suzy? <speaker:2> mm, no. No. <speaker:1> That's good. <speaker:2> I guess um I guess little Felipe is staying at your house. <speaker:1> yeah, I heard that might happen. yeah. And <speaker:2> um <speaker:1> I bet she loves that. <speaker:2> oh yeah. And every time I ask, because I see him at Kinko's all the time <speaker:1> uh-huh. And <speaker:2> um He's like she never leaves the house. All she does is bitch. <speaker:1> But it's so true. <speaker:2> He said that she just like goes for a bike ride and then stays home like the rest of the day <speaker:1> yeah. Why am I not surprised? yeah. So when I was thinking of who I was going to call, because you know this phone call is free. <speaker:2> oh it is? yeah <speaker:1> and I was <speaker:2> So we can talk as long as we want. <speaker:1> and like Well actually it's supposed to turn off in fifteen minutes. I think the whole thing is screwy. <speaker:2> oh. <speaker:1> But you know my dad was like well why don't you call Suzy. And I'm like that is the last person that I want to talk to. For <speaker:2> fifteen minutes. <speaker:1> I mean I talked to her like three weeks ago and all she did was bitch that I never paid some phone bill. Which I did. And she just forgot. Because she spent the money on something else. And I was just like, whatever. She's totally nutsy. If she like ends up trying to stay I'm going to have a nervous breakdown. <speaker:2> Well I think she's already determined to leave, isn't she? <speaker:1> yeah, but see, it's just like her the last minute be too lazy Right. to go through with it. yeah, I mean that's just, generally speaking, her personality. <speaker:2> yeah. <speaker:1> Because she was telling us she was going to move out last January. <speaker:2> mm. <speaker:1> And she was too lazy to do it. So maybe Felipe will drive her out. oh god I can't stand her."

constantly so it's funny that I don't see her more actually Yeah but now she's with her Yeah constantly I'm so happy for you though he's such a nice guy and now they're going up for the wedding aren't they Yeah cuz he was trying to get me to go with him and I was like this was before I even knew about the same thing and I was like I don't know I want to go so bad and I said but I don't have a date and then she's like go with us and thinking about it and then when I got the software to go to Madrid I was like oh I'd much rather go Spain than I can see all the wedding pictures I think that would be great So when are you going I think I'm going to go Thanksgiving that Uh-huh And you're just named for one week Yeah And I'm going to take I think I'm going to take some resumes around Yeah really I miss it so much Do you miss it now No not at all You know I guess you live there long enough to get it all out of your system Well now get this We might go to live in Switzerland Oh really Yeah cuz they've made him a job offer there and as far as he's thinking that he wasn't going to take it but now he's like well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then maybe he could get him to split in the door cuz they've united with AT&T and you know the Swiss phone company or whatever in California So he's speaking louder He gets foot in the door with AT&T so we might be easier to come back here later And as soon as I only have to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain We can learn German but I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go It's like no not another problem Yeah you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning That's true When would he be going He said as soon as possible like October Oh my god Then you wouldn't even be there I know I don't think we're going I hope not I mean I'd like it under other circumstances but is that what he eventually wants to get back to the states Yeah uh-huh That's good That's good for you cuz then you know that there's a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain Well we don't know Hopefully it's not Yeah Yeah Sounds funny that you're still sick of it That makes me laugh because I miss it so much I think I just missed the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored Yeah and probably when you were there yeah you were there cuz you wanted to be You want and you were working cuz you wanted to work there not cuz you had to Yeah you have to work everything Well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and my job's okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's cool I don't I hate my job so much Oh my God I can't wait like next Well my last name is Thursday but I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so happy Oh that's great Yeah extra time though Yeah it's coming up fast Now Rich is coming on Saturday next Saturday Oh my goodness Yeah we close Our week from November and have you heard from Alan and Ruben are they going up She wasn't sure because well she said it either Well she said she would definitely come at least try to come but Reuben might not cuz they're going to Spain first And then they're coming back here So then they thought maybe they'd come directly from Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it cost extra money So she wasn't sure what she was doing her how she was going to do it But I think she's definitely going to come As long as they can swing it I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her Yeah but he was here Yeah Christmas time is supposedly he was calling back in August but I don't know cuz I heard Well I heard it through Roberto who heard it from Sandy who heard it from Caroline Oh god So who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them So I don't know but she'll be up for the wedding right I don't know cuz I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming cuz she had to work or something on Friday But I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not So oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse Then you wonder Oh my goodness

no big deal But I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous Yeah I did that once before I don't want to do that again So I don't know anything on November

<speaker:2> Oh yeah <speaker:1> But now that much I'm with Rachel constantly so it's funny that I don't see her more actually Yeah <speaker:2> but now she's with her <speaker:1> Yeah constantly <speaker:2> I'm so happy for you though he's such a nice guy <speaker:1> and now they're going up for the wedding aren't they <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> cuz he was trying to get me to go with him and I was like this was before I even knew about the same thing and I was like I don't know I want to go so bad and I said but I don't have a date and then she's like go with us and thinking about it and then when I got the software to go to Madrid I was like oh I'd much rather go Spain than I can see all the wedding pictures I think that would be great So when are you going I think I'm going to go Thanksgiving that <speaker:2> Uh-huh And you're just named for one week <speaker:1> Yeah And I'm going to take I think I'm going to take some resumes around Yeah <speaker:2> really <speaker:1> I miss it so much Do you miss it now <speaker:2> No not at all <speaker:1> You know I guess you live there long enough to get it all out of your system Well <speaker:2> now get this We might go to live in Switzerland <speaker:1> Oh really Yeah <speaker:2> cuz they've made him a job offer there and as far as he's thinking that he wasn't going to take it but now he's like well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then maybe he could get him to split in the door cuz they've united with AT&T and you know the Swiss phone company or whatever in California So he's speaking louder He gets foot in the door with AT&T so we might be easier to come back here later And as soon as I only have to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain We can learn German but I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go It's like no not another problem Yeah <speaker:1> you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning <speaker:2> That's <speaker:1> true When would he be going <speaker:2> He said as soon as possible like October <speaker:1> Oh my god Then you wouldn't even be there <speaker:2> I know I don't think we're going I hope not I mean I'd like it under other circumstances but <speaker:1> is that what he eventually wants to get back to the states <speaker:2> Yeah uh-huh <speaker:1> That's good That's good for you cuz then you know that there's a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain <speaker:2> Well we don't know Hopefully it's not <speaker:1> Yeah Yeah Sounds funny that you're still sick of it That makes me laugh because I miss it so much I think I just missed the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored Yeah <speaker:2> and probably when you were there yeah you were there cuz you wanted to be You want and you were working cuz you wanted to work there not cuz you had to Yeah you have to work <speaker:1> everything Well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and my job's okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's <speaker:2> cool I don't I hate my job so much Oh my God I can't wait like next Well my last name is Thursday but I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so

definitely come at least try to come but Reuben might not cuz they're going to Spain first And then they're coming back here So then they thought maybe they'd come directly from Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it cost extra money So she wasn't sure what she was doing her how she was going to do it But I think she's definitely going to come <speaker:1> As <speaker:2> long as they can swing it I <speaker:1> heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her <speaker:2> Yeah but he was here <speaker:1> Yeah <speaker:2> Christmas time is supposedly he was calling back in August but I don't know cuz I heard Well I heard it through Roberto who heard it from Sandy who heard it from Caroline <speaker:1> Oh god So <speaker:2> who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them <speaker:1> So <speaker:2> I don't know <speaker:1> but she'll be up for the wedding right I <speaker:2> don't know cuz I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming cuz she had to work or something on Friday But I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not So oh goodness everything and from <speaker:1>

Thanksgiving that week uh-huh and you're just staying for one week yeah okay and I'm going to take um I think I'm going to take some resumes around yeah really I miss it so much do you do you miss it now no not at all You don't No I guess you lived there long enough to get it all out of your system yeah well now get this we might go to live in Switzerland oh really yeah because they've made him a job offer there and at first he's thinking nah he wasn't going to take it but now he's like well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then maybe he could get in his foot in the door with because they've united with A T and T uh-huh and then you know the Swiss phone company whatever and telefonika so he's thinking well that would he'd get his foot in the door with A T and T so it w- would might be easier to come back here later right and at first I thought oh yeah it would be nice to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain and right you know we could learn German but um that's true I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go it's like no not another problem not another move yeah you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning right yeah that's true when would he be going I don't know um be going he said as soon as possible like October oh my God I know then you wouldn't even be there I know but oh my goodness I don't think we're going I hope not I mean I'd like it under other circumstances but right is that what he eventually wants to get back to the States yeah uh-huh yeah well that's good that's good for you because then you know that it isn't a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain alright well we don't know hopefully it's not yeah yeah so that's funny that you're still sick of it that makes me laugh because I miss it so much I think I just miss the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored yeah and probably when you were there yeah you were there because you wanted to be you weren't w- and you were working because you wanted to work there not because you had to like yeah but it's just you have to work I just things I just hate everything well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and my job is okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's just well that's cool I don't know I hate my job so much oh my God I can't wait like next well my last day is Thursday but um oh c- I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so happy oh that's great yeah well do you need the extra time though yeah because it's coming up fast you know oh they're just coming on Saturday next Saturday oh my goodness yeah week from tomorrow oh that'll be fun or a week from whenever and have you heard from Ellen and Reuben are they going up um she wasn't sure because well she said ei- either well she said she would definitely come or at least try to come but Reuben might not because they're going to Spain first and then they're coming back here so then they thought maybe they'd come directly from Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it costs extra money so she wasn't sure what she was doing or how she was going to do it yeah but I think she's definitely going to come oh that's good as long as they can swing it yeah but I don't know if they'll and Erica I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her & yeah but he was here I think around a long time ago yeah Christmas time and supposedly he was coming back in August but I don't know because I heard well I heard it from Alberto who heard it from Sanju who heard it from Caroline oh God so who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them oh so I don't know but she'll be up for the wedding right I don't know because I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming because she had to work or something on Friday oh but I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not so oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse I know then you wonder oh my goodness well my friends I have two friends from France coming oh that's good yeah wow and is his family coming from Spain just his two sisters well that's good yeah that's good do they speak English no not really oh good that'll be fun and they don't they don't really want to come either oh God but that's okay oh I I don't really want them to come either yeah oh yeah that's right because you didn't get along well with his family yeah they're not very nice well his cousins and everything seems really nice and they've written back letters and stuff and they seem all excited to meet me and they're like we can't wait to meet our new cousin and stuff like that so oh well that's neat yeah and then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or what are your plans I'm just going to not work for a while and that's a good idea see what happens yeah oh goodness yeah you have a lot to do I know and I've got to ship all this stuff over there we've taken out a loan I can imagine because how else would you get everything I know oh my goodness what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you it is yeah but then I have a friend here who she's married and she has three little kids and um she's moving to Seattle and she's going to start studying oh my goodness and her husband is just quitting he's going to quit his job here and like look when he once he gets out there so at least she's kind of going through the same thing exactly so yeah I don't feel so alone yeah I was thinking about actually doing a master's in Madrid oh really and working like at working like at a T G I Friday's or someplace where I know they'd hire me oh right and then just working on a master's during the day and working at night who would you go with like N Y U or Middlebury I don't know I'm trying to find an American university that has master's programs N Y U has one for one year and I Amigamato I get a masters in one year? yeah yeah yeah in Madrid yep the whole year yeah and then I don't have to study at all in the States no uh-uh oh my God Marcelene thank you I'm going to write that down yeah and then Middlebury College you know in Vermont they have uh-huh you have to go for one summer to Vermont but it's just the summer and then you do one year in Madrid and you get a master's wow okay N Y U and what was the o- Middlebury yeah I'm going to go research them at Wash U this weekend then because um I'm just bored I don't know if it's just b- because I'm single and bored and there's like nobody in the midwest whose twenty-eight single no and and straight oh no most of my friends are single I was just saying like I mean I'm not the first one to get married at all but still I'm still in like that first bunch oh really yeah oh my wave must have struck early then because everybody I know is married or getting married and I'm so jealous oh really in fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend exboyfriend I don't know what he is but we're always together about your wedding and I was like I'm so excited he's going to be out of town or else I'd make him go and we'd go but um I was like I'm just so excited for her I said oh she's so lucky and then they're going to go live in Spain and blah and he's just like okay okay I'm sick of your friends that's all I talk about I'm just so happy for everybody but then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and I'm like stuck oh but it'll be worth the wait believe me I know how you feel it's horrid I know and you don't know what to do and like I can't seem to adjust to the family thing yeah th- well there's nothing you really can do I know just when you least suspect it that's when it'll happen yeah that's true well believe me I haven't been looking or waiting I'm like now tell me about this guy because I know I remember now that you told me something about him it's the same one believe it or not yeah he um was supposed to actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it until October oh really yeah uh he's in Korea right now for three weeks and then he's in Spain for two weeks so what's he doing in um in Missouri he works for Arthur Andersen oh oh that's right okay in Madrid and they sent him yeah and so he's on loan or whatever but he says wimpy things don't you hate when guys say like oh if things if if we if things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with oh yeah but oh that's such a wimp thing to say yup because if they really wanted to spend the rest of their lives with you they would make things different right exactly and I just looked at him and I thought you know y- you guys suck so what's wr- what's wrong now with your relationship according to him just the fact that w- he's leaving and I'm not going to answer the other line because oh I'm on long distance um just because he said well in October I'm going back to Spain first it was July and then he extended it and I saw his list of reasons why he'd extend and I was number one oh really and I'm like oh that's good yeah but then he's like oh it's just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much uh-huh that he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine oh right but he doesn't realize that we live different lives right for me you're willing to leave it's like it's no big deal because at the drop of a hat yeah I know it's like just say the word and I'm gone but I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous yeah well you did that already right yeah I did that once I don't want to do that again so I don't know well but maybe if you go in November he'll see you know yeah it'll be different it'll be different to be over there and see him so where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid yeah he lives well he lives um by Avenido de America oh okay he lives like toward the airport uh-huh which is good and uh his dad works at a bank his mother is French oh really yeah she does he speak French Yes he does, fluently",

circumstances but <speaker:1> right is that what he eventually wants to get back to the States <speaker:2> yeah uh-huh yeah <speaker:1> well that's good that's good for you because then you know that it isn't a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain <speaker:2> alright well we don't know hopefully it's not <speaker:1> yeah yeah <speaker:2> so <speaker:1> that's funny that you're still sick of it that makes me laugh because I miss it so much I think I just miss the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored <speaker:2> yeah and probably when you were there yeah you were there because you wanted to be you weren't w- and you were working because you wanted to work there not because you had to like <speaker:1> yeah but it's just <speaker:2> you have to work <speaker:1> I just things I just hate everything well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and my job is okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's just <speaker:2> well that's cool <speaker:1> I don't know <speaker:2> I hate my job so much oh my God I can't wait like next well my last day is Thursday but um <speaker:1> oh c- <speaker:2> I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so happy <speaker:1> oh that's great <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> well do you need the extra time though <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> because it's coming up fast <speaker:2> you know oh they're just coming on Saturday next Saturday <speaker:1> oh my goodness <speaker:2> yeah week from tomorrow <speaker:1> oh that'll be fun <speaker:2> or a week from whenever <speaker:1> and have you heard from Ellen and Reuben are they going up <speaker:2> um she wasn't sure because well she said ei- either well she said she would definitely come or at least try to come but Reuben might not because they're going to Spain first and then they're coming back here so then they thought maybe they'd come directly from Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it costs extra money so she wasn't sure what she was doing or how she was going to do it <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> but I think she's definitely going to come <speaker:1> oh that's good <speaker:2> as long as they can swing it yeah but I don't know if they'll <speaker:1> and Erica I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her <speaker:2> & yeah but he was here I think around <speaker:1> a long time ago <speaker:2> yeah Christmas time and supposedly he was coming back in August but I don't know because I heard well I heard it from Alberto who heard it from Sanju who heard it from Caroline <speaker:1> oh God <speaker:2> so who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them <speaker:1> oh <speaker:2> so I don't know <speaker:1> but she'll be up for the wedding right <speaker:2> I don't know because I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming because she had to work or something on Friday <speaker:1> oh <speaker:2> but I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not so <speaker:1> oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> then you wonder oh my goodness <speaker:2> well my friends I have two friends from France coming <speaker:1> oh that's good <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> wow and is his family coming from Spain <speaker:2> just his two sisters <speaker:1> well that's good <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> that's good do they speak English <speaker:2> no not really <speaker:1> oh good that'll be fun <speaker:2> and they don't they don't really want to come either <speaker:1> oh God <speaker:2> but that's okay <speaker:1> oh I <speaker:2> I don't really want them to come either <speaker:1> yeah oh yeah that's right because you didn't get along well with his family <speaker:2> yeah they're not very nice well his cousins and everything seems really nice and they've written back letters and stuff and they seem all excited to meet me and they're like we can't wait to meet our new cousin and stuff like that so <speaker:1> oh well that's neat <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> and then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or what are your plans <speaker:2> I'm just going to not work for a while and <speaker:1> that's a good idea <speaker:2> see what happens yeah <speaker:1> oh goodness <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> you have a lot to do <speaker:2> I know and I've got to ship all this stuff over there we've taken out a loan <speaker:1> I can imagine because how else would you get everything <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> oh my goodness what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you <speaker:2> it is yeah but then I have a friend here who she's married and she has three little kids and um she's moving to Seattle and she's going to start studying <speaker:1> oh my goodness <speaker:2> and her husband is just quitting he's going to quit his job here and like look when he once he gets out there so at least she's kind of going through the same thing <speaker:1> exactly <speaker:2> so yeah I don't feel so alone <speaker:1> yeah I was thinking about actually doing a master's in Madrid <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> and working like at working like at a T G I Friday's or someplace where I know they'd hire me <speaker:2> oh right <speaker:1> and then just working on a master's during the day and working at night <speaker:2> who would you go with like N Y U or Middlebury <speaker:1> I don't know I'm trying to find an American university that has master's programs <speaker:2> N Y U has one for one year <speaker:1> and I <speaker:2> Amigamato <speaker:1> I get a masters in one year? <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> in Madrid <speaker:2> yep <speaker:1> the whole year <speaker:2> yeah and then <speaker:1> I don't have to study at all in the States <speaker:2> no uh-uh <speaker:1> oh my God Marcelene thank you I'm going to write that down <speaker:2> yeah and then Middlebury College you know in Vermont they have <speaker:1> uh-huh <speaker:2> you have to go for one summer to Vermont but it's just the summer and then you do one year in Madrid and you get a master's <speaker:1> wow okay N Y U and what was the o- Middlebury <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> I'm going to go research them at Wash U this weekend then because um I'm just bored I don't know if it's just b- because I'm single and bored and there's like nobody in the midwest whose twenty-eight single <speaker:2> no <speaker:1> and and straight <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> no <speaker:2> most of my friends are single I was just saying like I mean I'm not the first one to get married at all but still I'm still in like that first bunch <speaker:1> oh really <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> oh my wave must have struck early then because everybody I know is married or getting married and I'm so jealous <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> in fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend exboyfriend I don't know what he is but we're always together about your wedding and I was like I'm so excited he's going to be out of town or else I'd make him go and we'd go but um I was like I'm just so excited for her I said oh she's so lucky and then they're going to go live in Spain and blah and he's just like okay okay I'm sick of your friends that's all I talk about I'm just so happy for everybody but then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and I'm like stuck <speaker:2> oh but it'll be worth the wait believe me I know how you feel <speaker:1> it's horrid <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> and you don't know what to do and like I can't seem to adjust to the family thing <speaker:2> yeah th- well there's nothing you really can do <speaker:1> I know <speaker:2> just when you least suspect it that's when it'll happen <speaker:1> yeah that's true well believe me I haven't been looking or waiting I'm like <speaker:2> now tell me about this guy because I know I remember now that you told me something about him <speaker:1> it's the same one believe it or not <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> he um was supposed to actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it until October <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> yeah uh he's in Korea right now for three weeks and then he's in Spain for two weeks <speaker:2> so what's he doing in um in Missouri <speaker:1> he works for Arthur Andersen <speaker:2> oh oh that's right okay <speaker:1> in Madrid and they sent him yeah and so he's on loan or whatever but he says wimpy things don't you hate when guys say like oh if things if if we if things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with <speaker:2> oh yeah but <speaker:1> oh that's such a wimp thing to say <speaker:2> yup <speaker:1> because if they really wanted to spend the rest of their lives with you they would make things different <speaker:2> right exactly <speaker:1> and I just looked at him and I thought you know y- you guys suck <speaker:2> so what's wr- what's wrong now with your relationship according to him <speaker:1> just the fact that w- he's leaving and I'm not going to answer the other line because <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> I'm on long distance um just because he said well in October I'm going back to Spain first it was July and then he extended it and I saw his list of reasons why he'd extend and I was number one <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> and I'm like oh that's good <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> but then he's like oh it's just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much <speaker:2> uh-huh <speaker:1> that he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine <speaker:2> oh right <speaker:1> but he doesn't realize that we live different lives <speaker:2> right <speaker:1> for me <speaker:2> you're willing to leave <speaker:1> it's like it's no big deal because <speaker:2> at the drop of a hat yeah <speaker:1> I know it's like just say the word and I'm gone but I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous <speaker:2> yeah well you did that already right <speaker:1> yeah I did that once I don't want to do that again so I don't know <speaker:2> well but maybe if you go in November he'll see you know <speaker:1> yeah it'll be different it'll be different to be over there and see him <speaker:2> so where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid <speaker:1> yeah he lives well he lives um by Avenido de America <speaker:2> oh okay <speaker:1> he lives like toward the airport <speaker:2> uh-huh <speaker:1> which is good and uh his dad works at a bank his mother is French <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> yeah she <speaker:2> does he speak French <speaker:1> Yes he does, fluently",

<speaker:1> Yeah constantly <speaker:2> I'm so happy for you though he's such a nice guy <speaker:1> and now they're going up for the wedding aren't they <speaker:2> Yeah cuz <speaker:1> he was trying to get me to go with him and I was like this was before I even knew about the same thing and I was like I don't know I want to go so bad and I said but I don't have a date and then she's like go with us <speaker:2> and <speaker:1> thinking about it and then when I got the software to go to Madrid I was like oh I'd much rather go Spain than I can see all the wedding pictures I think that would be great <speaker:2> So when are you going <speaker:1> I think I'm going to go Thanksgiving that <speaker:2> Uh-huh And you're just named for one week <speaker:1> Yeah And I'm going to take I think I'm

long enough to get it all out of your system <speaker:2> Well now get this We might go to live in Switzerland <speaker:1> Oh really <speaker:2> Yeah cuz they've made him a job offer there and as far as he's thinking that he wasn't going to take it but now he's like well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then maybe he could get him to split in the door cuz they've united with AT&T and you know the Swiss phone company or whatever in California So he's speaking louder He gets foot in the door with AT&T so we might be easier to come back here later And as soon as I only have to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain We can learn German but I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go It's like no not another problem <speaker:1> Yeah you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning That's true When would he be going <speaker:2> He said as soon as possible like October <speaker:1> Oh my

guy here visiting her <speaker:2> Yeah but he was here Yeah Christmas time is supposedly he was calling back in August but I don't know cuz I heard Well I heard it through Roberto who heard it from Sandy who heard it from Caroline <speaker:1> Oh god <speaker:2> So who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them So I don't know <speaker:1> but she'll be up for the wedding right <speaker:2> I don't know cuz I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming cuz she had to work or something on Friday But I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not So <speaker:1> oh goodness everything and from hearing it from country to country makes it even worse Then you wonder Oh my goodness <speaker:2> Well my friends I have two friends from France coming <speaker:1> Oh that's good <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> Wow And is his family coming from Spain <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> that's good Do they speak English <speaker:2> No not really <speaker:1> Well <speaker:2> they don't really want to come either But that's okay <speaker:1> I <speaker:2> don't really want them to come either <speaker:1> along well with his family <speaker:2> Well his problems and everything seems really nice and they've written back letters and stuff and they seem excited to meet me they're like we can't wait to meet our new cousin <speaker:1> Well that's me <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> and then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or <speaker:2> I'm just going to not work for a while and see what happens Yeah <speaker:1> You have a lot to do <speaker:2> Hello and I got to ship all this stuff over there We've taken out a loan <speaker:1> Can imagine because house would you get everything oh my goodness what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you <speaker:2> but then I have a friend here who she's married and she has three little kids and she's going to Seattle and she's going to start studying <speaker:1> Oh my goodness <speaker:2> and I have been is going to quit his job here and like look once he gets out there so at least she's kind of going through the same thing <speaker:1> Exactly <speaker:2> So yeah I don't feel so alone <speaker:1> Yeah I was thinking about actually doing a Masters in Madrid And working like at working like at TGI Fridays or someplace where I know they'd hire me <speaker:2> All right <speaker:1> and then just working on a master's during the day I'm working at night <speaker:2> Who would you go with Again why you or delivery <speaker:1> that has Master's program <speaker:2> NYU has one for one year <speaker:1> Let me <speaker:2> Galata <speaker:1> I get a master's in one year <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> Yeah <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> Madrid <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> the whole year <speaker:2> Yeah And then <speaker:1> he had all the mistakes <speaker:2> No <speaker:1> Oh my god Marshall I'm going to write that down <speaker:2> Yeah And then Middlebury College you know in Vermont they have You have to go for one summer to Vermont But it's just the summer And then You do one here in Madrid and you get a masters <speaker:1> Wow okay NYU and what was it Middlebury <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> I'm going to go research on that wash you and this weekend then Because I'm just bored I don't know if it's just cuz I'm single and bored and there's like nobody in the Midwest who's 28 single <speaker:2> No <speaker:1> and straight No <speaker:2> it's awesome My friends are single I was just saying like I mean I'm not the first one to get married at all but still I'm still in like that first bunch <speaker:1> Oh really <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> on my way there because everybody was married are getting married and I'm so jealous in fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend ex-boyfriend I don't know what he is but we're always together about your wedding and I was like I'm so excited he's going to be out of town or outside make him go and we go but I was like I'm just so excited for I said oh she's so lucky and then they're going to go live in Spain he's just like okay okay I'm sick of your friends now it's all I talk about I was just so happy for everybody But then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and I'm like stuck <speaker:2> Oh but it'll be worth the wait I believe me I know how you feel I know <speaker:1> and you don't know what to do and like I can't seem to adjust The only thing <speaker:2> you really can do <speaker:1> I know <speaker:2> When you least suspect then that's what all happened <speaker:1> Well believe me I haven't been looking or waiting South <speaker:2> tell me about this guy because I know I remember now you told me something about him <speaker:1> believe it or not actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it to October <speaker:2> Oh really <speaker:1> Yeah he's in Korea right now for 3 weeks and then he's in Spain for 2 weeks <speaker:2> So what's he doing in Missouri <speaker:1> He works for Arthur Anderson He's online or whatever but he like Oh things if if we things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with you they would make things different and I thought you know you guys suck <speaker:2> So what's what's wrong now with your relationship according to him <speaker:1> Just the fact that he's leaving I'm not going to answer the other one because I'm online distance Just because he said well in October I'm going back to Spain First it was July and then he extended it and I saw his list of reasons why he had extended and I was number one <speaker:2> Oh really <speaker:1> and I'm like oh that's good <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> but then he's like Oh it's just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much <speaker:2> and <speaker:1> he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine He doesn't realize that we live different <speaker:2> Right you're willing to be <speaker:1> like it's no big deal But I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous <speaker:2> Yeah <speaker:1> I did that once before I don't want to do that again So I don't know <speaker:2> anything on November he'll see you know <speaker:1> Yeah it'll be different It'll be different to be over there and see him <speaker:2> So where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid <speaker:1> Is dad works at a bank His mother's friend <speaker:2> Oh really <speaker:1> So if <speaker:2> you speak French <speaker:1> Yes he does",

I we don't talk that much I see her occasionally we all go out <speaker:2> oh yeah <speaker:1> um but not all that much I'm with Rachel constantly so it's funny that I don't see her more actually yeah <speaker:2> but <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> well now she's with Kurth <speaker:1> yeah constantly <speaker:2> I'm so happy for her though he's such a nice guy <speaker:1> he is nice and they're good together <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> and now they're going up for the wedding aren't they <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> uh-huh yeah because she was trying to get me to go with them and I was like this was before I even knew about the Spain thing and I was like I don't know I want to go so bad and I said but I don't have a date and then she's like go with us yeah so then I was thinking about it and then when I got this offer to go to Madrid I was like oh I'd much rather go visit them in Spain then I can see all the wedding pictures <speaker:2> yes <speaker:1> I thought that would be great so when are you going I think I might go Thanksgiving that week <speaker:2> uh-huh and you're just staying for one week <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> okay <speaker:1> and I'm going to take um I think I'm going to take some resumes around yeah <speaker:2> really <speaker:1> I miss it so much do you do you miss it now <speaker:2> no not at all <speaker:1> You don't <speaker:2> No <speaker:1> I guess you lived there long enough to get it all out of your system <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> well <speaker:2> now get this we might go to live in Switzerland <speaker:1> oh really yeah <speaker:2> because they've made him a job offer there and at first he's thinking nah he wasn't going to take it but now he's like well it's a really good offer and a good experience and then maybe he could get in his foot in the door with because they've united with A T and T <speaker:1> uh-huh <speaker:2> and then you know the Swiss phone company whatever and telefonika so he's thinking well that would he'd get his foot in the door with A T and T so it w- would might be easier to come back here later <speaker:1> right <speaker:2> and at first I thought oh yeah it would be nice to go to Switzerland it's really pretty it's green not like Spain and <speaker:1> right <speaker:2> you know we could learn German but um <speaker:1> that's true <speaker:2> I don't know but now with all the wedding it's all hectic and everything now I don't want to go it's like no not another problem not another move yeah <speaker:1> you'd rather be someplace familiar at least at the beginning <speaker:2> right yeah that's <speaker:1> true when would he be going <speaker:2> I don't know um <speaker:1> be going <speaker:2> he said as soon as possible like October <speaker:1> oh my God <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> then you wouldn't even be there <speaker:2> I know but <speaker:1> oh my goodness <speaker:2> I don't think we're going I hope not I mean I'd like it under other circumstances but <speaker:1> right is that what he eventually wants to get back to the States <speaker:2> yeah uh-huh yeah <speaker:1> well that's good that's good for you because then you know that it isn't a permanent thing that you'll be going to Spain <speaker:2> alright well we don't know hopefully it's not <speaker:1> yeah yeah so that's funny that you're still sick of it that makes me laugh because I miss it so much I think I just miss the freedom and the fun because I'm so bored yeah <speaker:2> and probably when you were there yeah you were there because you wanted to be you weren't w- and you were working because you wanted to work there not because you had to like yeah <speaker:1> but it's just <speaker:2> you have to work <speaker:1> I just things I just hate everything well not really I mean it's not that bad I'm working and my job is okay I use my Spanish and stuff but it's just <speaker:2> well that's cool I don't <speaker:1> know <speaker:2> I hate my job so much oh my God I can't wait like next well my last day is Thursday but um <speaker:1> oh c- <speaker:2> I'm only scheduled till Tuesday I'm so happy <speaker:1> oh that's great yeah well do you need the extra time though <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> because it's coming up fast <speaker:2> you know oh they're just coming on Saturday next Saturday <speaker:1> oh my goodness yeah <speaker:2> week from tomorrow <speaker:1> oh that'll be fun <speaker:2> or a week from whenever <speaker:1> and have you heard from Ellen and Reuben are they going up <speaker:2> um she wasn't sure because well she said ei- either well she said she would definitely come or at least try to come but Reuben might not because they're going to Spain first and then they're coming back here so then they thought maybe they'd come directly from Spain here but they weren't sure and then you know it costs extra money so she wasn't sure what she was doing or how she was going to do it <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> but I think she's definitely going to come <speaker:1> oh that's good as <speaker:2> long as they can swing it yeah but I don't know if they'll <speaker:1> and Erica I heard she had some Spanish guy here visiting her <speaker:2> & yeah but he was here I think around <speaker:1> a long time ago yeah <speaker:2> Christmas time and supposedly he was coming back in August but I don't know because I heard well I heard it from Alberto who heard it from Sanju who heard it from Caroline <speaker:1> oh God so <speaker:2> who knows if it's true or not but that yeah like things weren't going that great with them <speaker:1> oh so <speaker:2> I don't know <speaker:1> but she'll be up for the wedding right I <speaker:2> don't know because I thought she was but then I heard through the grapevine that she wasn't coming because she had to work or something on Friday <speaker:1> oh <speaker:2> but I don't know I don't know if any of that's true or not so oh goodness everything and from <speaker:1> hearing it from country to country makes it even worse <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> then you wonder oh my goodness <speaker:2> well my friends I have two friends from France coming <speaker:1> oh that's good yeah <speaker:2> wow <speaker:1> and is his family coming from Spain <speaker:2> just his two sisters <speaker:1> well that's good <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> that's good do they speak English no <speaker:2> not really <speaker:1> oh good that'll be fun <speaker:2> and they don't they don't really want to come either <speaker:1> oh God but <speaker:2> that's okay <speaker:1> oh I <speaker:2> I don't really want them to come either <speaker:1> yeah oh yeah that's right because you didn't get along well with his family <speaker:2> yeah they're not very nice well his cousins and everything seems really nice and they've written back letters and stuff and they seem all excited to meet me and they're like we can't wait to meet our new cousin and stuff like that so <speaker:1> oh well that's neat <speaker:2> yeah and <speaker:1> then what are you going to teach English or are you just going to not work for a while or what are your plans <speaker:2> I'm just going to not work for a while and <speaker:1> that's a good idea <speaker:2> see what happens yeah <speaker:1> oh goodness <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> you have a lot to do <speaker:2> I know and I've got to ship all this stuff over there we've taken out a loan <speaker:1> I can imagine because how else would you get everything <speaker:2> I know <speaker:1> oh my goodness what a pain it does sound like a pain to be honest with you <speaker:2> it is yeah but then I have a friend here who she's married and she has three little kids and um she's moving to Seattle and she's going to start studying oh <speaker:1> my goodness <speaker:2> and her husband is just quitting he's going to quit his job here and like look when he once he gets out there so at least she's kind of going through the same thing <speaker:1> exactly <speaker:2> so yeah I don't feel so alone <speaker:1> yeah I was thinking about actually doing a master's in Madrid <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> and working like at working like at a T G I Friday's or someplace where I know they'd hire <speaker:2> me oh right <speaker:1> and then just working on a master's during the day and working at night <speaker:2> who would you go with like N Y U or Middlebury <speaker:1> I don't know I'm trying to find an American university that has master's programs <speaker:2> N Y U has one for one year and I Amigamato <speaker:1> I get a masters in one year? <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> yeah yeah in Madrid <speaker:2> yep <speaker:1> the whole year yeah and then I don't have to study at all in the States <speaker:2> no uh-uh <speaker:1> oh my God Marcelene thank you I'm going to write that down yeah <speaker:2> and then Middlebury College you know in Vermont they have <speaker:1> uh-huh <speaker:2> you have to go for one summer to Vermont but it's just the summer and then you do one year in Madrid and you get a master's wow <speaker:1> okay N Y U and what was the o- Middlebury <speaker:2> yeah I'm <speaker:1> going to go research them at Wash U this weekend then because um I'm just bored I don't know if it's just b- because I'm single and bored and there's like nobody in the midwest whose twenty-eight single <speaker:2> no <speaker:1> and and straight <speaker:2> oh no most of my friends are single I was just saying like I mean I'm not the first one to get married at all but still I'm still in like that first bunch <speaker:1> oh really <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> oh my wave must have struck early then because everybody I know is married or getting married and I'm so jealous <speaker:2> oh really in <speaker:1> fact I was totally telling my my Spanish boyfriend exboyfriend I don't know what he is but we're always together about your wedding and I was like I'm so excited he's going to be out of town or else I'd make him go and we'd go but um I was like I'm just so excited for her I said oh she's so lucky and then they're going to go live in Spain and blah and he's just like okay okay I'm sick of your friends that's all I talk about I'm just so happy for everybody but then I see everybody else getting on with their lives and I'm like stuck <speaker:2> oh but it'll be worth the wait believe me I know how you feel <speaker:1> it's horrid <speaker:2> I <speaker:1> know and you don't know what to do and like I can't seem to adjust to the family thing <speaker:2> yeah th- well there's nothing you really can do I know just when you least suspect it that's when it'll happen <speaker:1> yeah that's true well believe me I haven't been looking or waiting <speaker:2> I'm <speaker:1> like <speaker:2> now tell me about this guy because I know I remember now that you told me something about him <speaker:1> it's the same one believe it or not <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> he um was supposed to actually go back to Spain in July but he extended it until October <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> really yeah uh he's in Korea right now for three weeks and then he's in Spain for two weeks so <speaker:2> what's he doing in um in Missouri <speaker:1> he works for Arthur Andersen <speaker:2> oh oh that's right okay <speaker:1> in Madrid and they sent him yeah and so <speaker:2> he's <speaker:1> on loan or whatever but he says wimpy things don't you hate when guys say like oh if things if if we if things were only different I know you would be the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with <speaker:2> oh yeah but <speaker:1> oh that's such a wimp thing to say <speaker:2> yup <speaker:1> because if they really wanted to spend the rest of their lives with you they would make things different <speaker:2> right exactly <speaker:1> and I just looked at him and I thought you know y- you guys suck so <speaker:2> what's wr- what's wrong now with your relationship according to him <speaker:1> just the fact that w- he's leaving and I'm not going to answer the other line because <speaker:2> oh <speaker:1> I'm on long distance um just because he said well in October I'm going back to Spain first it was July and then he extended it and I saw his list of reasons why he'd extend and I was number one <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> and I'm like oh that's good <speaker:2> yeah <speaker:1> but then he's like oh it's just so hard to know what to do and I think because he loves his family so much uh-huh that he would never even dream of asking me to leave mine <speaker:2> oh right <speaker:1> but he doesn't realize that we live different lives right for me you're willing to leave it's like it's no big deal because <speaker:2> at the drop of a hat yeah <speaker:1> I know it's like just say the word and I'm gone but I won't go back to Spain for a guy unless it's a sure thing because that's ridiculous <speaker:2> yeah well you did that already right <speaker:1> yeah I did that once I don't want to do that again so I don't know <speaker:2> well but maybe if you go in November he'll see you know <speaker:1> yeah it'll be different it'll be different to be over there and see him <speaker:2> so where does he live in Madrid right in Madrid <speaker:1> yeah he lives well he lives um by Avenido de America <speaker:2> oh okay <speaker:1> he lives like toward the airport <speaker:2> uh-huh <speaker:1> which is good and uh his dad works at a bank his mother is French <speaker:2> oh really <speaker:1> yeah <speaker:2> she does he speak French <speaker:1> Yes he does, fluently"
